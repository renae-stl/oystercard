# Extracting the journey log out of the Oystercard

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

So that was fun - we now have a simple station class that can hold information about a station's zone, and a journey class holding the state of each individual journey. We also saw how to extract 1 class into 2 classes, using our tests as a scaffold. Now let's have another look at our Oystercard class and make some improvements. Currently our Oystercard has two responsibilities: maintaining a balance through touch in/out and recording a journey history. We should be following Single Responsibility Principle, so we still have some refactoring to do.

Let's extract a JourneyLog class. It should be responsible for starting a journey, ending a journey and returning a list of journeys.

## Learning Objectives covered
- [ ] Define Dependency Inversion as one of the SOLID principles.

## Interview questions you may expect:
- [ ] Describe one of the SOLID principles.

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] test drive the development of `JourneyLog` class
- [ ] Initialise the `JourneyLog` with a `journey_class` parameter (hint: `journey_class` expects an object that knows how to create `Journey`s.  Can you think of an object that already does this?)
- [ ] `#start` should start a new journey with an entry station
- [ ] a private method `#current_journey` should return an incomplete journey or create a new journey
- [ ] `#finish` should add an exit station to the `current_journey`
- [ ] `#journeys` should return a list of all previous journeys without exposing the internal array to external modification
- [ ] remove redundant code from OysterCard class

### Hints

  <ul>
    <li>This is another tricky one. Take your time, move in small increments, and have an idea of what it is you want to do before jumping in and doing it.</li>
    <li>The `JourneyLog` will need to be able to create `Journey` objects, but you'll want to avoid creating a hard dependency. Make use of dependency injection to pass the `Journey` in.</li>
    <li>Using an attr_reader to return you journeys array will return the actual object, which eaves it open to being tampered with by pesky users. You'll want to avoid this by investigating ways that Ruby will allow you to return a copy of the array.</li>
  </ul>
