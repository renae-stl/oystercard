- [ ] Update your test suite to reflect a new Journey class. Make a new spec file journey_spec.rb
- [ ] Create a new class Journey and move the functionality that relates to a journey from Oystercard to Journey.
Test drive the development of your journey class. Each journey should have an entry and an exit station. Instances of journey should be initialized with an optional entry station, and respond to `#finish`, `#fare` and `#complete?` methods.
- [ ] Make sure all tests pass, all existing functionality is preserved. You will need to send messages to your Journey class from your Oystercard class - remember to use doubles to test that the correct messages are being sent.
- [ ] The `#fare` method should return the correct fare, or the penalty fare of 6 if there was either no entry station or no exit_station.

Remember to test all the different combinations of zones. You may need to write some private methods to keep your external interface clean.

- [ ] Make sure the entire codebase is DRY
- [ ] Make sure all methods are three lines or shorter

At this point it is very important to manually feature test your application in IRB - do the two classes communicate effectively?

Here is an example of a spec file for a journey class - there are many ways to make this work, this is only one such way.

```ruby
require 'journey'
describe Journey do
  let(:station) { double :station, zone: 1}

  it "knows if a journey is not complete" do
    expect(subject).not_to be_complete
  end

  it 'has a penalty fare by default' do
    expect(subject.fare).to eq Journey::PENALTY_FARE
  end

  it "returns itself when exiting a journey" do
    expect(subject.finish(station)).to eq(subject)
  end

  context 'given an entry station' do
    subject {described_class.new(entry_station: station)}

    it 'has an entry station' do
      expect(subject.entry_station).to eq station
    end

    it "returns a penalty fare if no exit station given" do
      expect(subject.fare).to eq Journey::PENALTY_FARE
    end

    context 'given an exit station' do
      let(:other_station) { double :other_station }

      before do
        subject.finish(other_station)
      end

      it 'calculates a fare' do
        expect(subject.fare).to eq 1
      end

      it "knows if a journey is complete" do
        expect(subject).to be_complete
      end
    end
  end
end
```
