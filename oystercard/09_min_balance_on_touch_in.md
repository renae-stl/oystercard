# Checking minimum balance on touch in

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

Now your Oyster card can be used to touch in and out. However, it will let you touch in even if you haven't got enough funds for a single journey.

If your card is empty, you wouldn't get past the entry barrier on London transport network. This is because when you try to touch in, it checks the balance and refuses to touch in unless you have enough money for one journey.

Let's implement this check. Assume that the minimum fare is £1 and raise an exception unless the balance is at least £1 on touch in.


```
In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need to have the minimum amount (£1) for a single journey.
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- Raise errors
- Check that a statement raises an error with RSpec
- Use a constant
- Access a constant from outside the class

## Interview questions you may expect:
- What are constants and how are they different from variables? Why use them?
- What are exceptions in Ruby? Why do they have messages associated with them?
- How can you check an expression raises an error with RSpec? Why do you have to pass the code as a block to do this?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] Write a test that checks that an error is thrown if a card with insufficient balance is touched in
- [ ] Write the implementation
- [ ] Update existing tests, if necessary, to make sure they still pass
- [ ] Refactor to remove any magic numbers and replace with a constant

### Hints

  <ul>
    <li>The first thing to think about, as always, is writing a test to cover this requirement. If you don't remember how to test whether an error has been raised, check the links below for more information.</li>
    <li>With a test in place, you can now implement the feature.  There will be a few things to think about here - where to check that the card has sufficient balance, how to raise an error if it doesn't, and how this new behaviour might affect your existing tests.</li>
    <li>It's likely at this point, that some of your earlier tests will fail.  Think about why this is happening.</li>
    <li>Once your tests are green again, you might want to think about using context blocks within your spec file to avoid duplication and organise your tests.</li>
  </ul>
